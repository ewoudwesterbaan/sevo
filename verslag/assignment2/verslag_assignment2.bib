Abstract = {The article focuses on the practices recommended for using color in graphs. The ability of people to perceive colors can be applied to data visualization in useful ways but it is often misapplied because most of them do not understand it and the limitations of its use. It is important to use soft colors, except when people wish to highlight specific data. It is also necessary to use color with a single, neutral background. Several systems for describing and manipulating color were also discussed.},
